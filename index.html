            <h1>Database Objects</h1> 
        <p>
            A database object is any defined object in a database that is used to store or reference data. Oracle Database recognizes objects that are associated with a particular schema and objects that are not associated with a particular schema

        There are two types of database objects
        <ul>
            <li>Schema Objects</li>
            <li>Non Schema Objects</li>
            </ul>
        A schema is a collection of logical structures of data, or schema objects. A schema is owned by a database user and has the same name as that user. Each user owns a single schema. Schema objects can be created and manipulated with SQL and include the following types of objects: 
        <ul>
            <li>Table</li>
            <li>Index</li>
            <li>View</li>
            <li>Cursor</li>
            <li>Record</li>
            <li>Package</li>
            <li>Procedure</li>
            <li>Function</li>
            <li>Object</li>
            <li>Database Link</li>
            <li>Sequence</li>
            <li>Trigger</li>
            <li>Constraints</li>
        </ul>

        Schema objects do not have a one-to-one correspondence to physical files on disk that store their information. However, Oracle stores a schema object logically within a tablespace of the database. The data of each object is physically contained in one or more of the tablespace's datafiles. For some objects, such as tables, indexes, and clusters, you can specify how much disk space Oracle allocates for the object within the tablespace's datafiles.
            There is no relationship between schemas and tablespaces: a tablespace can contain objects from different schemas, and the objects for a schema can be contained in different tablespaces.
        </p>

        <h2>Tables</h2>
<p>Tables are the basic unit of data storage in an Oracle database. Data is stored in rows and columns.

Create table employees (employee_id number, first_name varchar(20))

    You define a table with a table name (such as employees) and set of columns. You give each column a column name (such as employee_id, and last_name), a datatype (such as VARCHAR or NUMBER), and a width.</p>

        <h2>Indexes</h2>
<p>Indexing is a concept of listing of keywords accompanied by the location of information of the subject. Indexes are used to speed up the processing, especially searching.
You can create many indexes for a table as long as the combination of columns differs for each index. You can create more than one index using the same columns if you specify distinctly different combinations of the columns.<br/><br/>

CREATE INDEX employees_idx1 ON employees (last_name, job_id);<br/>
CREATE INDEX employees_idx2 ON employees (job_id, last_name);<br/><br/>

    The above statements create indexes on employees table.</p>
        <h2>View</h2>
A view is a way of hiding the logic that created the joined table just displayed. 
A view is a tailored presentation of the data contained in one or more tables or other views. A view takes the output of a query and treats it as a table. Therefore, a view can be thought of as a stored query or a virtual table. You can use views in most places where a table can be used.<br/><br/>

Select * from employees where employee_id > 120;<br/><br/>

Returns a view of a table containing the desired result.
        <h2>Cursor</h2>
A cursor is a pointer to this context area, a memory area for processing an SQL statement which contains all the information needed for processing the statement.
A cursor holds the rows (one or more) returned by a SQL statement.
There are two types of cursors: - 
<ul>
    <li>Implicit Cursor - are automatically created by Oracle whenever an SQL statement is executed</li>
    <li>Explicit Cursor - are programmer-defined cursors for gaining more control over the context area.</li>
        </ul>
DECLARE  <br/>
   total_rows number(2); BEGIN <br/>
   UPDATE customers <br/>
   SET salary = salary + 500; <br/>
   IF sql%notfound THEN <br/>
      dbms_output.put_line('no customers selected'); <br/>
   ELSIF sql%found THEN <br/>
      total_rows := sql%rowcount; <br/>
      dbms_output.put_line( total_rows || ' customers selected '); <br/>
   END IF; <br/>  
        END; <br/><br/>
This will update the table and increase the salary of each customer by 500 and use the SQL%ROWCOUNT attribute to determine the number of rows affected

        <h2>Record</h2>
Records are another type of datatypes which oracle allows to be defined as a placeholder. Records are composite datatypes, which means it is a combination of different scalar datatypes like char, varchar, number etc.  Each scalar data types in the record holds a value. A record can be visualized as a row of data. It can contain all the contents of a row.<br/><br/>

TYPE record_type_name IS RECORD 
(first_col_name column_datatype, 
second_col_name column_datatype, ...);<br/><br/>

        <ul>
            <li>record_type_name – it is the name of the composite type you want to define.</li>
            <li>first_col_name, second_col_name, etc.,- it is the names the fields/columns within the record.</li>
            <li>column_datatype defines the scalar datatype of the fields.</li>
        </ul>
        This declares a composite database.
        <h2>Package</h2>
Package is a logical grouping of a related subprogram (procedure/function) into a single element. A Package is compiled and stored as a database object that can be used later.
Package has two components: -
<ul>
    <li>Package Specification - consists of a declaration of all the public variables, cursors, objects, procedures, functions, and exception.</li>
    <li>Package Body - consists of the definition of all the elements that are present in the package specification. It can also have a definition of elements that are not declared in the specification, these elements are called private elements and can be called only from inside the package.</li>
        </ul>
CREATE [OR REPLACE] PACKAGE BODY &lt;package_name&gt;<br/>
IS<br/>
&lt;Private element definition&gt;<br/>
&lt;sub_program and public element definition&gt;<br/>
.<br/>
BEGIN<br/>
&lt;Package Initialization&gt;<br/>
END &lt;package_name&gt;<br/><br/>
The above syntax shows the definition of package initialization in the package body.
        <h2>Procedure</h2>
A procedure is a block with a declarative section, an executable section and an exception handling section. 
Parameters can be passed to a procedure. 

        <h2>Function</h2>
CREATE [OR REPLACE] FUNCTION function_name<br/>
   [ (parameter [,parameter]) ]<br/>

   RETURN return_datatype<br/>

IS | AS<br/>

   [declaration_section]<br/>

BEGIN<br/>
   executable_section<br/>

[EXCEPTION exception_section]<br/>

        END [function_name];<br/><br/>
When you create a procedure or function, you may define parameters. There are three types of parameters that can be declared:
        <ol>
            <li>IN - The parameter can be referenced by the procedure or function. The value of the parameter can not be overwritten by the procedure or function.</li>
            <li>OUT - The parameter can not be referenced by the procedure or function, but the value of the parameter can be overwritten by the procedure or function.</li>
            <li>IN OUT - The parameter can be referenced by the procedure or function and the value of the parameter can be overwritten by the procedure or function.</li>
        </ol>


        <h2>Object</h2>
Oracle object types are user-defined types that make it possible to model real-world entities, such as customers and purchase orders, as objects in the database. 
Object types and related object-oriented features, such as varrays and nested tables, provide higher-level ways to organize and access data in the database. Underneath the object layer, data is still stored in columns and tables, but you can work with the data in terms of the real-world entities that make the data meaningful. Instead of thinking in terms of columns and tables when you query the database, you can simply select entities that you have created, such as customers and purchase orders.You can begin to use object-oriented features while continuing to work with most of your data relationally, or you use to an object-oriented approach entirely.<br/>

CREATE TYPE&lt;object_type_name&gt; AS OBJECT<br/>
(<br/>
&lt;attribute_l&gt;&lt;datatype&gt;,<br/>
.<br/>
.<br/>
);<br/>
CREATE TYPE BODY&lt;object_type_name&gt; AS OBJECT<br/>
(<br/>
MEMBER[PROCEDURE|FUNCTION]&lt;member_name&gt;<br/>
IS<br/>
&lt;declarative section&gt;<br/>
BEGIN<br/>
&lt;execution part&gt;<br/>
END;‭<br/>
.<br/>
.<br/>
);<br/><br/>
The above syntax shows the creation of 'OBJECT' with attributes and 'OBJECT-BODY' with methods.The methods can also be overloaded in the object body.


        <h2>Database Link</h2>
A database link is a schema object in one database that enables you to access objects on another database. The other database need not be an Oracle Database system. However, to access non-Oracle systems you must use Oracle Heterogeneous Services. After you have created a database link, you can use it to refer to tables and views on the other database.<br/><br/>

CREATE PUBLIC DATABASE LINK remote <br/>
   USING 'remote';<br/><br/>
The above statement defines a shared public database link named remote that refers to the database specified by the service name remote

        <h2>Sequence</h2>
Tables usually have a primary key which uniquely identifies a row in a table. A sequence is a unique number generator which can be assigned to the primary keys of the tables.
create sequence xyz 
increment by 1 
start with 1;

        <h2>Trigger</h2>
Triggers are constructs that need to be just created and associated with a table.
Once they are created, the table associated with it gets updated due to an UPDATE, INSERT or a DELETE, the triggers get implicitly fired depending upon the instructions passed to them.
In many cases, triggers supplement the standard capabilities of Oracle to provide a highly customized database management system. <br/><br/>

CREATE TABLE account (acct_num INT, amount DECIMAL(10,2));<br/>
CREATE TRIGGER ins_sum BEFORE INSERT ON account<br/>
        -> FOR EACH ROW SET @sum = @sum + NEW.amount;<br/><br/>

The CREATE TRIGGER statement creates a trigger named ins_sum that is associated with the account table. It also includes clauses that specify the trigger action time, the triggering event, and what to do when the trigger activates:
        <ul>
            <li>The keyword BEFORE indicates the trigger action time. In this case, the trigger activates before each row inserted into the table. The other permitted keyword here is AFTER.</li>
            <li>The keyword INSERT indicates the trigger event; that is, the type of operation that activates the trigger. In the example, INSERT operations cause trigger activation. You can also create triggers for DELETE and UPDATEoperations.</li>
            <li>The statement following FOR EACH ROW defines the trigger body; that is, the statement to execute each time the trigger activates, which occurs once for each row affected by the triggering event. In the example, the trigger body is a simple SET that accumulates into a user variable the values inserted into the amount column. The statement refers to the column as NEW.amount which means “the value of the amount column to be inserted into the new row.”</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Constraints</h2>
        <p>
        Oracle constraints are critical to the scalability, flexibility and integrity of your database data. Constraints apply specific rules to data, ensuring the data conforms to the requirements defined. Oracle Database lets you create six types of constraints and lets you declare them in two ways. These are:
            <ul>
                <li>Check Constraint</li> 
                <li>Not Null</li>
                <li>Primary Key</li>
                <li>Unique Key</li>
                <li>Foreign Key</li>
                <li>A REF constraint lets you further describe the relationship between a REF column, references an object in another object type or in a relational table, and the object it references.</li>  </ul>

Syntactically, you can define constraints in two ways:
        <ul>
            <li>As part of the definition of an individual column or attribute. This is known as inline specification.</li>
            <li>As part of the table definition. This is known as out-of-line specification. </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Check Constraint</h3>
Check constraints validate that values in a given column meet a specific criteria. For example, you could create a check constraint on a varchar2 column so it only can contain the values T or F <br/><br/>
 Create table my_status<br/>
( status_id NUMBER,<br/>
  person_id NUMBER,<br/>
  active_record VARCHAR2(1) NOT NULL<br/>
  CHECK (UPPER(active_record)='T' or<br/>
  UPPER(active_record)='F')<br/>
); <br/><br/>
In this example we created a table called my_status. This examples shows in-line constraints because the constraints are defined in the same line as the column definition. This constraint checks whether the value of varchar2 is only T or F.

        <h3>NOT NULL Constraints</h3>
NOT NULL constraints are constraints that prohibit a database value from being null. NOT NULL constraints must be declared inline. <br/><br/>

Create table my_status<br/>
( status_id NUMBER NOT NULL);<br/><br/>

This prohibits the value of status_id from being null in the my_status table.
        <h3>Primary Key Constraints</h3>
Primary key constraints define a column or series of columns that uniquely identify a given row in a table. Defining a primary key on a table is optional and you can only define a single primary key on a table. Any column that is defined as a primary key column is automatically set with a NOT NULL status. <br/><br/>

Create table my_status<br/>
( status_id NUMBER PRIMARY KEY);<br/><br/>

This sets the column of status_id as the primary key of my_status table.

        <h3>Unique Constraints</h3>
Unique constraints are like alternative primary key constraints. A unique constraint defines a column, or series of columns, that must be unique in value. You can have a number of unique constraints defined and the columns can have NULL values in them, unlike a column that belongs to a primary key constraint. <br/><br/>

Create table my_status<br/>
( status_id NUMBER,<br/>
  person_id NUMBER UNIQUE);<br/><br/>

This sets the value of person_id column to be unique.
        <h3>Foreign Key Constraints</h3>
A foreign key constraint enforces a relationship between two tables. It requires values in one table to match values in another table. A foreign key is a field (or collection of fields) in one table that refers to the primary key in another table. The table containing the foreign key is called the child table, and the table containing the candidate key is called the referenced or parent table. <br/><br/>
CREATE TABLE Persons (<br/>
	PersonID int PRIMARY KEY,<br/>
	firstName varchar(20),<br/>
	lastName varchar(20)<br/>
        );<br/><br/>
CREATE TABLE Orders (<br/>
    OrderID int PRIMARY KEY,<br/>

    OrderNumber int NOT NULL,<br/>

    PersonID int FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES Persons(PersonID)<br/>
); <br/><br/>
To allow naming of a FOREIGN KEY constraint, and for defining a FOREIGN KEY constraint on multiple columns, we use this kind of syntax: <br/><br/>

CREATE TABLE Orders (<br/>

    CONSTRAINT FK_PersonOrder FOREIGN KEY (PersonID)<br/>

    REFERENCES Persons(PersonID)<br/>
        );<br/><br/><br/>
